## Project Goals
Chalk Talk is designed to be a fitness companion for users of all levels, from beginners to seasoned athletes. The primary goals of the web app are to:

- Deliver a user-friendly and engaging platform where users can create and share posts, follow other users, and make use of personal records and percentage calculation on a daily basis.
- Provide users with tools to use on a daily basis, track personal records, share thoughts and feelings through posts, fostering a supportive and motivating community.
- Ensure a streamlined experience with essential features like personal records documentation, community engagement, and the ability to manage profiles, posts, and comments.

The backend is implemented using Django Rest Framework API for the Chalk Talk Website. It is designed to support both web and future mobile applications providing robust and secure APIs for the Chalk Talk React frontend application, ensuring seamless integration and future scalability.
