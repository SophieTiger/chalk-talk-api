## Project Goals
Chalk Talk is designed to be a fitness companion for users of all levels, from beginners to seasoned athletes. The primary goals of the web app are to:

- Deliver a user-friendly and engaging platform where users can create and share posts, follow other users, and make use of personal records and percentage calculation on a daily basis.
- Provide users with tools to use on a daily basis, track personal records, share thoughts and feelings through posts, fostering a supportive and motivating community.
- Ensure a streamlined experience with essential features like personal records documentation, community engagement, and the ability to manage profiles, posts, and comments.

The backend is implemented using Django Rest Framework API for the Chalk Talk Website. It is designed to support both web and future mobile applications providing robust and secure APIs for the Chalk Talk React frontend application, ensuring seamless integration and future scalability.

## Planning
The planning phase for the Chalk Talk project encompasses several key areas to ensure the successful development and deployment of both the backend and frontend components. Here is a comprehensive plan to guide the development process:

### Project Overview
Chalk Talk is a comprehensive fitness platform designed to help users stay connected with their community to get inspired and inspire others on a daily basis. The platform includes features such as personal record documentation, weight percentage calculator, and social interaction to create a supportive and motivating environment for users.

### Objectives
Develop a robust backend API using Django Rest Framework to handle data management and user authentication.
Build an intuitive and responsive frontend using React to provide a seamless user experience.
Integrate key features such as user profiles, posts, comments, likes, personal records, and weight calulation.

### Timeline
- Iteration 1: Project Setup and Initial Development

  - Set up backend and frontend repositories.
  - Configure Django Rest Framework for the backend.
  - Initialize React project for the frontend.
  - Set up initial project structure and environment configurations.

- Iteration 2: User Authentication and Profile Management

  - Implement user registration, login, and logout functionality.
  - Develop user profile creation and editing features.
  - Ensure secure password handling and authentication processes.

- Iteration 3: Core Features Development

  - Develop the functionality for creating, editing, and deleting posts.
  - Implement comments and likes features for posts.
  - Develop personal records features, including creation and management.

- Iteration 4: Frontend Integration and Styling

  - Integrate backend API with the frontend.
  - Develop responsive and user-friendly UI components.
  - Apply consistent styling using CSS modules or a CSS framework.

- Iteration 5: Testing and Debugging

  - Conduct thorough testing of all features.
  - Fix any bugs or issues identified during testing.
  - Perform user acceptance testing (UAT) to ensure the platform meets user needs.

- Iteration 6: Deployment and Documentation

  - Deploy the backend API to a cloud service (e.g., Heroku).
  - Deploy the frontend application to a hosting service (e.g., Heroku).
  - Write comprehensive documentation, including setup instructions, API documentation, and user guides.
